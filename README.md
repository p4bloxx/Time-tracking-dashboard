## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS vanilla
- Sass(preprocessor css) [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Cube css

### What I learned

I created this challenge as a small exercise mainly regarding the layout. I didn't find any difficulties, overall it was an excellent review exercise.

The code works, I tried to make it responsive for most devices used and different screen orientations, overall everything is fine.

### Continued development

### Useful resources

I will continue with slightly more complex challenges to raise the bar on my development skills.
